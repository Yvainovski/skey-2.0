	bin		- contains binary 
	incldue - contains libraries
	lib     - for .a files
	man     - where man pages go after buid
	other   - other files
	buildall- a script that automaticall runs configure and make, make install

./key [ flags ][ count ] [ password ] <sequence #>[/] <key>
Use any following flag before [count] and [password].
Flags should be used before [count][password]
[-h] : only print usage message.
[-v] : print current version.
[-d] : Increase debugging level by one.  May be specified multiple times.
Debugging level 1 will show entry/exit point of every function.
Level 2 will also show return values about to be returned from
functions.  Level 3 will also show arguments passed to functions.
If declare more than 3 times, it will be the same as Level 3.

INSTALL
---------------
1. autoreconf -i
2. ./configure && make CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror"
Then
-  binaries in skey-2.0/bin
-  man pages in skey-2.0/man
-  libraries in skey-2.0/lib
-  headers in skey-2.0/include
3. Can also run "Make install" to install to $(HOME)/bin
NOTE: Make sure to check $PATH has $(HOME)/bin after install

make check :  run script to check the program on various inputs and outputs, and determines if the output matches what's expected.  

make dist : generate the distribution : skey_2.0.tar.gz

Alternatively:
buildall : run ./buidall to automatically configure, make, and install 

---------------
UNINSTALL/CLEAN
---------------
- 'make clean' will delete all the generated files 
- 'make uninstall' will uninstall files form $(HOME)/bin
